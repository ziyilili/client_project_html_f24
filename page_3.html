            <h2>AM I A FIRST-GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENT?</h2>
            <h3>At the University of Michigan, undergraduates and graduate students are considered first-generation college students if neither parent or guardian has completed a 4-year college or university degree. This definition includes students with other family members (siblings, cousins, grandparents, etc.) who have completed a four-year degree. </h3>
            <p>The University of Michigan – Ann Arbor is proud to be named as a First-Gen Forward Institution by the NASPA Center for First-generation Student Success. This designation recognizes our commitment to improving the experience and outcomes of first-generation college students.</p>

                    <p>Bachelor of Science in Information student Shantaisa King shares her journey of transferring from Grand Rapids Community College to the School of Information. "Coming here and spending some time figuring out how information can be used to solve social issues, I knew that was where I needed to be," King recalls of her weekend at the UMSI Community College Summer Institute. Now a senior in the BSI, King is doing research with Professor Kentaro Toyama as she prepares for her next big goal: earning a PhD.</p>

            <h2>Who’s a ‘First-Gen’ Student?</h2>
            <h3>Here’s a New Look at a Complicated Question: </h3>
            <p>
                Let’s imagine that you’re reading an application from a prospective college student whose mother never enrolled at a postsecondary institution and whose father earned a bachelor’s degree. Would you consider them a first-generation student?
  
                But wait, let’s say their father earned his degree in another country. What then? OK, now let’s imagine that the father earned a four-year degree at a domestic college, but the applicant doesn’t live with him and has no contact with him. Might you consider them “first gen”?
  
                Researchers at the Common Application explore such questions in a new brief on “first-generation” status, a long-familiar term that lacks a universal meaning; colleges use varying definitions, which often vexes applicants and college counselors. “This confuses a lot of people, and they’re right to be confused,” says Brian Heseung Kim, director of data science, research, and analytics at the Common Application and the lead author of the brief.

            <h2>Event: University of Michigan Celebrates First-Generation College Students During Week-Long Events?</h2>
            <p>
                From October 30th through November 3rd, the University of Michigan will host the First-Generation College Student Celebration Week, inviting the entire campus community to come together, celebrate and better understand the unique experiences of first-generation college students. This dedicated week offers a chance for faculty, staff and students to celebrate, learn about, and engage, with U-M’s first-generation college student community.

                This tradition aligns with colleges and universities nationwide who join in hosting events and commemorations around November 8th. This date marks Lyndon B. Johnson’s signing of the Higher Education Act (HEA) of 1965, a landmark moment in history. The act laid the foundation for federal financial aid programs, vital for funding students’ education. It included crucial investments in higher education institutions. The Federal TRIO programs, which emerged as part of the HEA, are of particular significance. These programs prioritize equitable access, retention, and successful completion of post-secondary education for today’s first-generation college students and those with limited income.

                While First-Generation Celebrations acknowledge the invaluable contributions of first-generation college students to their communities and the broader realm of higher education, they also spotlight the pressing need for systemic changes. These changes are crucial to dismantling the barriers that often impede the success of first-generation college students in their academic journeys.

                “For a long time, the experience of being first-generation has been framed as a deficit or something that only creates challenges. But first-generation students come from so many backgrounds and have so many experiences that contributed to their coming to college and their success,” says Terra Molengraff, Director of First-Generation Student Initiatives at the University of Michigan.
