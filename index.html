                    <h3>Maintaining your mental well-being is crucial for thriving in graduate school. Here are resources to support your mental health:</h3>
                    <p>UHS primary care providers are highly skilled in providing mental health care including medication management, and can address most mental health concerns like anxiety, depression, eating disorders, and basic sleep problems. If they determine you require specialist-level care, they will provide you with a referral for consultation at your next primary care visit. Specialty clinics include Psychiatry, Sleep Medicine, and the Eating and Body Image Concerns (EBIC) Clinic (available only to U-M students taking classes or UHS Prepaid Plan members who have a referral from a UHS clinician). You may be asked to return to your PCP after the initial consultation since this allows for continuity of care.</p>

                <h2>Life Outside the Classroom</h2>
                <h3>Graduate school is more than just academics. Here are some resources to help you enjoy life outside the classroom:</h3>
                <p>It's important to cultivate a balanced life. With over 1,400 registered student organizations on campus, the University of Michigan has something for everyone. Student organizations focus on a variety of interest areas such as academic and professional development, visual and performing arts, athletic and recreational clubs, community service, environmental interests, religious/ethnic groups, political and social action, student government, and more. In addition, about 20% of Michigan students choose to participate in fraternities or sororities on campus. 

                As a parent or family member, you should encourage your student to seek out ways to get connected to campus through student organizations. Finding a balance between academic work and extracurricular activities is essential to a well-rounded and successful student. Participation in student activities outside of class not only provides a much-needed break from the intense academic rigors, but also helps many students to manage their time better, and can lead to a more rewarding and successful college experience. If your student is having trouble figuring out where to begin, the Center for Campus Involvement is here to help.</p>
