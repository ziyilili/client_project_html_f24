            <h2>OUR MISSION</h2>
            <h3>To ensure members of the University of Michigan community—whether on a tight budget or physically restrained from getting to a grocery store—receive equitable access to healthy, nutritious, and nourishing food and the ability to prepare it for themselves or others. </h3>
            <p>
                Maize was simply defined as the color of corn, but the committee emphasized the pale lemon yellow “should be avoided.” In hopes of ending color drift, the committee chose maize and blue ribbons to be the exemplars for all official University of Michigan colors from then on. College students and staff are experiencing food insecurity at alarming rates. The Maize and Blue Cupboard is here to provide an immediate and comprehensive response for the U-M community. By offering resources, educational opportunities, compassionate support and more, we help students develop the skills to make informed decisions.
