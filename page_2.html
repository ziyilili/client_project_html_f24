          <h2>Where are we? </h2>
          <p>Our Front Desk (Michigan Union 4th Floor) is open and ready to help support you -- staff members are available throughout the day to assist you with your needs to answer questions, and get you to the right place. We can be reached by phone at: (734) 764-8312. CAPS has a limited number of private spaces available for students to connect with their counselor via telecounseling. Please contact the front desk for more information on those private spaces. Please Note: During high-demand periods, CAPS will be unable to accommodate class-related interviews and/or projects. Many students are able to find the information they need within our website and our annual reports.</p>
          <p>CAPS office is unable to participate in scavenger hunts for students due to maintaining the confidentiality of our clients. However, you are welcome to direct students to the wellness zone, which has a separate entrance adjacent to CAPS. If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the CAPS office. </p>

        <h2>Individual Peer Counseling</h2>
        <h3>What peer counselors can offer? </h3>
        <p>We are undergraduate and graduate students at UM and can relate to the struggles of being a student here. Peer Counselors are trained by CAPS staff to support students in a variety of areas: loneliness and making friends, adjustment and transition to U of M, the state of Michigan, or the United States as a whole, learning about campus resources, managing academic and life stress, and more. Our primary goal is to listen and support you, and provide resources where needed.</p>
        <h3>Benefits of peer counseling</h3>
        <p>Peer counseling can offer students a relaxed and laid back place to vent and find support. We are able to listen and relate, as well as give you a judgment-free space to talk out your thoughts. Students have reported appreciating having someone outside of their immediate circle to talk to as well as someone who is able to support them in working through personal challenges.</p>
        <h3>Meet the Peer Counselors</h3>
        <p>We invite you to check out the PC Team below.  All Peer Counselors have gone through training and participate in weekly consultation facilitated by CAPS Staff.  </p>
