              Our Front Desk (Michigan Union 4th Floor) is open and ready to help support you -- staff members are available throughout the day to assist you with your needs to answer questions, and get you to the right place. We can be reached by phone at: (734) 764-8312. CAPS has a limited number of private spaces available for students to connect with their counselor via telecounseling. Please contact the front desk for more information on those private spaces. Please Note: During high-demand periods, CAPS will be unable to accommodate class-related interviews and/or projects. Many students are able to find the information they need within our website and our annual reports.

          <h2>Individual Peer Counseling</h2>
          <p>Welcome to CAPS Individual Peer Counseling! Individual Peer Counseling (IPC) is designed to offer a new way to meet the needs of students across the University of Michigan. We are here to support student mental health and offer students a place to vent. Peer counselors are trained in active listening by professional staff here at CAPS. The IPC program connects students with someone of a similar age, interest and background who can serve as a resource or simply someone to “rant” to. While Peer Counselors will keep all information private, IPC is not a substitute for confidential therapy provided by a licensed mental health CAPS staff member.</p>

          <h2>A Brief Note of Support Regarding the Violence in Israel and Gaza</h2>
          <p>CAPS extends its support to all our students who are being impacted by the current violence in Israel and Gaza. We recognize the understandable grief, fear and anger that many of our students may be experiencing right now, especially our students who are Israeli, Palestinian, or have ties to or loved ones in those regions. We encourage all of you to take care of and be compassionate with yourselves and each other;  it is in times like these, that we can come together as a community, and in fact, we need to.</p>

          <h2>Self-Care For Incidents Of Campus Climate Concerns</h2>
          <p>When faced with social injustices and bias incidents, it is extremely difficult to cope and know what to do.  Feeling overwhelmed with the current socio-political state, experiencing discrimination, or being impacted by contentious people or policies increases stress which remains correlated to negative mental health outcomes.  During these times, it remains imperative that we take care of ourselves, take care of loved ones, and take care of our campus community. We all have the power to spread kindness, celebrate diversity and inclusion, and promote social justice.</p>
